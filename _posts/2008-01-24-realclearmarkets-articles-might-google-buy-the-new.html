<a href="http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2008/01/might_google_buy_the_new_york.html">RealClearMarkets - Articles - Might Google Buy the New York Times?</a><br/><p>A Google acquisition of the New York Times seems entirely plausible to me after reading this post.</p><p>The acquisition would be a deal for Google. Jut take a look at  how their values compare. NY Times is $2 billion. Google?Â  A whopping $185 billion. Money is not a core issue in this one. </p><p> Shareholders would jump at the chance to sell their stake.  </p><p>Placing all the chips on Arthur Sulzberger is a huge risk and quite possibly a losing one.  </p><p>The New York Times is a wonderful newspaper but people just don&#8217;t access information like before. Ad revenue is in decline as department stores consolidate, etc.</p><p>With Google, The New York Times could compete against News Corp., the Times emerging arch rival. Rupert Murdoch bought the Wall Street Journal to compete directly with the Times. </p><p>The list of reasons go on and on. I respect the dignity of the Sulzbergers but they have had every chance to get it right and they have not.</p><p>I grew up with the New York Times. My Dad used the New York Times to show me how to read the baseball box scores. It was on our breakfast table every day. I would hate to see the Times decline into such a sorry state that people would just stop caring about it. </p><p><a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/01/22/nyTimesOnTheInternet.html">Via Scripting News</a></p>
