title: 'GuapoComicsandCoffeeWe’re off to Guapo Comics tomorrow morning for coffee
  and donuts with some good pals. It’s a comic joint. I have never been a comic guy
  but the Guapo site says they have something for everyone. They have some recommended
  comic outfits like Tugboat Press. I added a few of their terrific cartoon covers
  in the previous posts. The kids have gift certificates. Looks like we’ll have a
  steady diet of comics for the day. Excellent. We’ll head back home, start a fire,
  relax and read. Not a bad Sunday. '
