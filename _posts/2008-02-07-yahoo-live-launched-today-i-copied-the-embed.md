<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="400" height="352" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab"><param name="movie" value="http://live.yahoo.com/swf/player/djbuzzkill" /><embed src="http://live.yahoo.com/swf/player/djbuzzkill" width="400" height="352" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer"></embed></object><br/><p><a href="http://live.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Live</a> launched today. I copied the embed code from the djbuzzkill live stream featured on the Yahoo! Live home page.  All kinds of problems with this  &#8220;experimental&#8221; launch. To their credit, they come right out and say their servers are <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hazardsociety/2249440329/">"smoking."</a> At the Yahoo! Live home page, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hazardsociety/2250131676/">"Whoa!"</a> is the headline for their apology. I have never seen so many &#8220;we&#8217;re sorry&#8221; notices! Even this web address refers to the problems: <a href="http://live.yahoo.com/weknow.html"><a href="http://live.yahoo.com/weknow.html">http://live.yahoo.com/weknow.html</a></a> </p><p>How will Yahoo! manage the load when people start copying and pasting embed codes from other profiles and adding it to their blog or social network pages like I did here? We know this issue over at <a href="http://splashcastmedia.com">SplashCast</a>. But streaming live is a whole other story! Whoa! </p><p>But isn&#8217;t this launch fantastic, too? The team at Yahoo! Live is so self depreciating. For me, that&#8217;s a telltale sign. They are confident in what they developed. They can make fun of themselves. Users can sense that confidence. They&#8217;ll come back because they trust the Yahoo! Live team will get it right.</p><p>It makes me sad in a way. Yahoo! has established its own distinct style for social media applications. Does Microsoft have its own social media style? I&#8217;m not so sure. Will Microsoft eradicate Yahoo&#8217;s style if the buyout does occur? I wonder&#8230; </p><p>Warts and all, the team at Yahoo! Live know they have the community features in place. The chat in different colors is kick butt. The ui is simple. Launching a live player took seconds as all I needed to do was log in to Yahoo! I should check that statement about launching a player. I have not been able to see myself live yet and I even put my nice dress coat over my pj&#8217;s! Do I look like <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hazardsociety/2249464657/">Uncle Fester?</a></p><p>It&#8217;s that Yahoo! style that would be a real shame to lose. Google does a great job with social apps. I can name a dozen start ups who have succeeded in this regard. But for some reason, Yahoo! is just friendlier. It&#8217;s like visiting an old pal. Familiar, friendly and easy to get along with&#8230; even if he is a bit flaky at times. :-) </p><br clear="all"/>
