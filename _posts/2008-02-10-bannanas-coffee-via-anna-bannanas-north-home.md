title: 'Bannanas Coffee (via Anna Bannana’s North Home Page)Anna Banana’s is my new
  favorite coffee shop in Portland. They provide a free copy of the New York Times.
  They serve bagel and lox with capers, red onions and cream cheese. They brew Caffe
  D’Arte, my bean of choice. The shop opens early and closes late. The not too big
  screen is always tuned to a soccer match. Four beers are on tap. It’s our Sunday
  morning destination.   '
