title: 'I talked on the phone today with a guy who is one of the founders of a company
  called ApexExposure. They do a lot of campaigns for music labels, promoting, working
  with online street teams to generate some buzz for artists. I saw on their web site
  that they are out of Brooklyn. I grew up in Brooklyn as a kid so I asked where and
  he said Dumbo. Dumbo? I had never heard of it. He said it is the area between the
  Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge. That area was such a dump when I was a kid.
  You would never, ever venture there. Now it is getting posh. The community has a
  blog: Dumbo NYC, Brooklyn (DumboNYC.com)  Check out these condos for sale. Prices
  start at around $700k. '
