title: 'SXSW ‘08 Insider’s GuideGoing to SXSW? Here’s a golden source. It’s the SWXW
  08’ Insiders Guide put together by the talented Corey Denis. My bet is this will
  be a sure ass source for what’s happenng at SWSW this year. Twitter was the app
  last year at SXSW. What will be the go to app this year?I have a few nominees: NingYahoo!
  LivePownceTwitter (again)My bet is on Ning and Twitter. Why? What do you do when
  trying to figure out where to go and what to do at SXSW? Go to Twitter and follow
  the buzz about the parties, the sessions or where people are getting a cocktail.
  No invites needed. Just follow the tweets.Ning enhances Twitter. Ning is where you
  can connect  with folks. Add them to your Twitter friends list.  It’s an excellent
  source for what bands to check out, where to crash if you are like me and still
  not sure if you are going or not. SXSW is all about networking, getting into the
  flow and learning tons. Twitter and Ning are the combo that I would use to make
  sure I got the most out of an event that requires inside info that anyone can access.'
