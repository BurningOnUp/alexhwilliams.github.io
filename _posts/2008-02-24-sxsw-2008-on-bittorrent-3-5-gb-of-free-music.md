title: 'SXSW 2008 on BitTorrent: 3.5 GB of Free Music | TorrentFreakI saw that Robert
  Scoble used Bittorrent to download 3.5 gigs of music from bands playing at this
  year’s SXSW Music Festival.  Since 2005, SXSW made the music available in BitTorrent.
  For whatever reason, this year it has not happened so Greg Hewgill decided to do
  it the himself. viva p2p! :-) '
