<a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/2/akamai_wins_limelight_patent_suit_45_5_million">Akamai Wins Limelight Patent Suit, $45.5 Million - Silicon Alley Insider</a><br/><p>How many start-ups will be affected by the outcome of this lawsuit? <a href="http://curry.podshow.com/?p=1003">Adam Curry</a> posted about it today, saying  the Podshow nework will not be affected by the ruling against Limelight. Interesting that he felt compelled to write about the suit. Podshow must be significantly invested in Limelight. </p><p>Overall concern is that Limelight may have to shut down their network. </p><p>"If the verdict holds up, it would be devastating for Limelight, whose shares are down almost 40% in afternoon trading. Last year the company lost $24 million on $66 million of revenue. And if the judge issues an injunction against Limelight, it might have to <b>shut down</b> its network. &#8220;</p>
