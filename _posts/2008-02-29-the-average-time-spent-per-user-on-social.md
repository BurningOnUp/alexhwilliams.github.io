title: 'The average time spent per user on social networks has fallen 14 percent in
  the last four months, according to ComScore. MySpace, the No. 1 social network,
  has seen its traffic fall from 72 million users in October to 68.9 million in December.
  ‘What you have with social networks is the most over-hyped scenario in online advertising,’
  says Tim Vanderhook, CEO of Specific Media. That said, advertising on social networks
  is growing fast: eMarketer, a research firm, expects advertising on social networks
  to surge 75 percent to $2.1 billion this year, up from $1.2 billion in 2007. But
  could it be that advertisers are late to a party that’s ending? Perhaps. Business
  Week calls the projection ‘unrealistic’, because aside from slowing growth, advertisers
  and ad network operators say social networking users are becoming less responsive
  to ads. If that trend continues, social networking could end up just another niche
  market, ‘smashing hopes and valuations across Silicon Valley.’'
