<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2008/tc20080303_000743.htm">Building a Brand with Widgets</a><br/><p>The demand for branded widgets will continue but the proof is there that the concept determines its success in social networks.</p>In it first phase, the widget world has witnessed the rise of entertainment widgets. In the second phase, the market will see widgets that are more useful than entertaining.<p>But it will come down to the concept and the widget&#8217;s usefulness for the user and its value to the site or profile page.</p><p>Provide that value and the widget will have a better chance of organic growth, something I&#8217;d far prefer if I were a widget developer or a client looking for maximum brand exposure. </p><p> </p>
