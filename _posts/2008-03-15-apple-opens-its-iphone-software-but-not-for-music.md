<a href="http://nz.entertainment.yahoo.com/080315/5/4gub.html">Apple opens its iPhone software, but not for music - Yahoo!Xtra News</a><br/><p>Another post for music Saturday. I saw so many people with iphones while at SXSW. I was so engulfed, rhapsodized by their elegance. But they certainly are not music phones! Apple is keeping iTunes all locked up to extensions such as iLike. Apps can be built off Safari but they don&#8217;t get the same exposure since they are not written with the Apple SDK.</p><p>That doesn&#8217;t look like it will disrupt developers. They are just keen on the iPhone for the quality service it allows. Seeqpod is a prime example. They recently lauched an iPhone app that acts as a streaming music search engine.</p>
