I heard the news today from Ellen, his girlfriend, the woman he calls &#8220;his grounding force&#8221; in this interview I did with the two of them last year. He loved Ellen. They met last year. She said it was the sweetest time with Russ.  I believe it. Russell looked great the last time I saw him. Ellen said that they had started talking about the rest of their lives together. She said she planned to retire in a year. Russ said he had no plans to retire. He would write until the very end.</p><p>Russell loved his work. <a href="http://marshallk.com">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> called him the &#8220;hardest working&#8221; blogger in the business. <a href="http://corante.com">Corante</a> founder Hylton Joliffe introduced me to Russ. Hylton said &#8220;you have to meet Russell. He&#8217;s a rock star.&#8221;  </p><p>Russell was a rock star blogger. He would wake at 4 a.m., write until 10 a.m. and then take a two hour nap. He&#8217;d then work until 10 p.m. He wrote as many as ten posts a day for such publications as Huffington Post and ZDNet. Andy Abramson said Russell was best known for his <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/blackberry/">BlackBerry blog</a> that he was often the most proud of and his work with ZD Net where he blogged on all things <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/">Telecom.</a></p><p>When Ellen called, she said to sit down. She told me the news. I cried. Russ and I were buddies. I felt I knew him more than most folks. He had a big heart and a quick wit. Most of all, he&#8217;d listen and could relate to many of the issues I faced in my personal life. He&#8217;s what you wanted in a friend.  </p><p>Funny, at SXSW, I kept thinking about Russ. I needed to touch base with him. I wanted to invite him and Ellen to our wedding. Ellen, I hope you will be there with us. </p><p>Judy asked today where I thought Russ might be right now. I though of his love for trains. I said he must be on a train, happy to be with loved ones.</p><p>I can&#8217;t believe he is gone.  </p><br/>
