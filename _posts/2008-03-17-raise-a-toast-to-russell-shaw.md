<p><img align="right"/><img src="http://www.blackberrycool.com/wp-content/uploads/russ2.jpg" align="right" height="269" width="200"/>Bloggers, everyone - come on out Wed. night to the <a href="http://portland.metblogs.com/2008/03/05/portland-metblog-meetup-march-19/">Metblog party</a> at the Green Dragon and raise a pint with me to good ol’ Russell Shaw. I’ll be there to remember my good friend and Metblog colleague who passed away last weekend. Let’s share a laugh and a story about the hardest working blogger in the business. Russ and I both blogged for Metblog so it will be good to see some friends and familiar faces. Hope to see you there. The Green Dragon is at 928&#160;SE 9th Ave. in Portland. </p>
