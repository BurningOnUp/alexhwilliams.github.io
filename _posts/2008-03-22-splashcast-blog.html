It&#8217;s nice to be a SplashCast alumni and watch the company&#8217;s great success. </p><p>Good summary about SplashCast by Rick Turoczy at <a href="http://siliconflorist.com/2008/03/20/splashcast-social-advertising-tees-up-4-million/">Silicon Florist,</a> explaining how the company is taking on traditional advertising.</p>
