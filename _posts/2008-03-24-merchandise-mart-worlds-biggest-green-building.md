title: 'Merchandise Mart: World’s Biggest Green Building : TreeHuggerNeat story about
  the Merchandise Mart:"The effort required overhauling decades-old practices and
  technology, from replacing most of the Mart’s 4,000-plus windows and upgrading rusty
  motors deep in its subbasements to taking better care of dust mops. The reward:
  At 78 years of age, the Merchandise Mart is now the biggest green building in the
  world."                                                               Business Week
  notes that “the return has been quick: Thanks to the upgrades, utility bills last
  year fell about 10%, and occupancy rates climbed to 96%, from 77% a decade ago.
  “We’ve had a wave of interest,” says Christopher G. Kennedy, president of Merchandise
  Mart Properties and an heir to former building owner Joseph P. Kennedy. “One prospective
  tenant, who had passed us over, came back because they require a LEED space.” '
