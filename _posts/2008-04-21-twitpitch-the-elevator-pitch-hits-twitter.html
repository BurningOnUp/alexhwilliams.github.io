It&#8217;s called the #twitpitch.</p><p>Borrowing from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitpitch_the_elevator_pitch_hits_twitter.php">Read Write Web</a>, here is how it works:</p><p>To further explain the concept, Boyd put forth a set of rules for the pitches as follows:</p>  <ol><li><i>All companies who would like to have a meeting with me, need to send me a Twittered description of the product. Yes, please Twitter it to me at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/stoweboyd.">www.twitter.com/stoweboyd.</a> Yes, one tweet, 140 characters less the eleven used for &#8220;@stoweboyd &#8220;.</i> </li><li><i>Optionally, send a supporting twitpitch with one link, and no other text. Could be to anything: website, video, press release, Rick Astley, etc.</i> </li><li><i>Then, twitter me one or more suggested times/place to meet at the event, using the times on the calendar, and a location in the conference building I won&#8217;t have time to visit your nearby hotel or offices.</i> </li></ol>
