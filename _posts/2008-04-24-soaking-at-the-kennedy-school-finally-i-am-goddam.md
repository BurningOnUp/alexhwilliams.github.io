<p><img src="http://www.mcmenamins.com/bin/kennedy%20soak.jpg" height="215" width="344"/></p><p>I am sitting in the soaking pool at the <a href="http://www.kennedyschool.com/index.php?loc=57#null">Kennedy School</a> and thinking why not just think of everything as a garden? Don&#8217;t roll your eyes, goddamit. Hang with me for a minute. Look out the door and think of a garden. Walk down the street. Think of it as a garden. Think garden first and then what should go in the garden. A soaking pool is perfect for a garden. A chicken coop would work in our garden. Gardens first then think how the cars get through. How does the car fit with the garden? How do we fit in the garden?   </p><p>I had never soaked at the Kennedy School. Judy is always raving about the goddam place. Finally, I am standing outside the office today and I am chilled to the goddam bone. It had taken almost six months for me to get cold. I needed a soak. Tonight.</p><p>I got out of the pool and had another thought. I am tired of being polite in my blog. I like to cuss. So, goddamit, I am going to cuss. Sure.</p><p>A great date night all in all. We even came home to Judy&#8217;s lemon bars. Now that&#8217;s what I am talking about! Shit, yeah! </p><p>I </p>
