People on Friendfeed converse. What do you find on blogs? Comment moderation. Why? Vicious behavior, trolling and a tendency for people to engage in pretty much nasty behavior. </p><p>Heh. I can comment on Robert Scoble&#8217;s FriendFeed and see it immediately appear but on <a href="http://scobleizer.com">his blog</a> I get a message that the comment is getting moderated. Though to be fair, it took less than a minute for a recent comment to appear on Robert&#8217;s blog post. </p><p>Is there a decorum not present on blogs or have the spammers and the trolls just not found their way to FriendFeed yet?</p>
