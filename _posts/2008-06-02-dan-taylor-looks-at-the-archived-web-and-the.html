Dan has this to say about <a href="http://iterasi.blogspot.com">iterasi</a>: Â </p><blockquote><p>One service which probably isn&#8217;t about to revolutionise the wholesale archiving of the web, but may just be a portent of the future, is <a href="http://www.iterasi.com/">iterasi</a>. Originally unveiled at <a href="http://www.demo.com/">DEMO</a> in January and launched as a public beta last month, iterasi is a dynamic bookmarking service which, in their own words, &#8220;makes it simple for any Web user to save the dynamically generated pages that are increasingly becoming the bulk of today&#8217;s Web experience&#8221;. The service works by means of a browser plug-in (IE 7 or Firefox 2, but currently PC only - although they confirmed by e-mail that they&#8217;re working on a Mac-compatible version) which enables you to &#8220;notarize&#8221; any page - saving it to your iterasi account, complete with the description and tags of your choosing, from where it can be viewed, emailed and embedded. Below is a &#8220;notary&#8221; of the BBC homepage, captured at 9:07 this morning. (<b>See Dan&#8217;s post for the BBC page he embedded. I can&#8217;t embed it here. Tumblr has limited capabilties for embedding images in the text field of a post.</b>)</p><p>I think it&#8217;s a fantastic service and can&#8217;t wait for the Mac-compatible plug-in so I can fully integrate it with my online life. Whether it marks the start of a more nuanced approach to capturing the dynamic web, only time will tell. The smart money, as ever, is on Google. </p></blockquote>
