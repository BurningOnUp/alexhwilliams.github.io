This morning, more than 5,000 new tweets. About every ten to 15 minutes, the real time results show how many new tweets have appared since I last refreshed. Looks like obama gets about 60 to 70 new tweets every 10 minutes or so. Interesting that &#8220;obama&#8221; is not one of the trending topics but &#8220;clinton&#8221; is in that category.</p>
