<p>In response to <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/06/17/what-you-frame-is-what-you-get/trackback">Doc Searls</a> post this morning:</p>
<p>In the past few years, content has continued to spread as a term to describe poems, essays, illustrations, music and the endless other forms of personal expression. What deserves protection so these forms of personal expression do not become illegal acts? Should the pipes and containers that hold digital media be protected? If we do not protect the transportation mechanisms then they will eventually be policed. And if they are policed, then what rights do we have?</p>
