It’s not easy. When I upload a video, Viddler auto sets an image, usually a frame that is 5 to 6 seconds into the video. Setting a new preview image does not seem to work. I have repeatedly clicked on the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hazardsociety/2612043695/">&#8221;+&#8221; icon</a> and then “set thumbnail.” But the change never shows in the Viddler player on the web page.<br/><br/>Is there a trick that I can do in iMovie to avoid the problem on Viddler? is there a work around in Viddler? I’ve looked around and have not seen much written on the topic.<br/><br/>What are the technical reasons for why this is an issue? Is this issue true across most hosted video sites?<br/><br/>Still pretty new to video editing and the tricks to making it just right.</p>
