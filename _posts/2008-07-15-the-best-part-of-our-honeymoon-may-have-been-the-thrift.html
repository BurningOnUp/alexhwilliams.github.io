I told them they can call us the &#8220;Thrifty Mooners.&#8221; We are always looking for a honey of a deal. I think that&#8217;s some of the most awesome corniness I have come up with for a whie.</p>
<p>We found treasures on our honeymoon. We came back with four 1950s era lawn chairs with cushions that have this glowing yellow floral print; a pink button down sweater for Judy; exacto knife set; a white western button down shirt with red and white stitching; a brown leather jacket; a short sleeve, light blue bowling shirt; records: Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Willie Nelson, etc.; a green ball cap from Spanky&#8217; RV Repair; two skirts for Judy; four pair of black running socks; drinking glasses; a nut chopper; a lamp for my daughter&#8217;s room; coloring and chidren&#8217;s books for the nieces; fudge for the kids;Â  a desk lamp for Judy; arts and crafts waste basket and a pair of binoculars we traded for a $1, 1950s vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>And it all fit in the Volvo. :-)</p>
