<a href="http://sivers.org/bye-bye-baby">Bye-Bye, Baby! | Derek Sivers: CD Baby Sells to Disc Makers</a><br/><p><a href="http://sivers.org/bye-bye-baby">CD Baby sold to Disc Makers</a> for undisclosed price. CD Baby is a pillar of the Portland music business.  We are known here in Portland for our rich, indie music scene. The music business part of the show is catching up with a number of new small labels like <a href="http://www.pampelmoose.com">Pampelmoose</a> and services such as <a href="http://www.rumblefish.com">Rumblefish</a>. But CD Baby is the definite leader, though, it is a CD business which automatically raises questions about its viability.</p>
<p>There are questions about the new owner. Disc Makers has served the indie market for years but never saw the opportunity that Derek did with CD Baby. Is Disc Makers too late? Will the company carry on the spirit that Derek instilled? If not, how will that affect the company and the indie artists CD Baby serves? Derek served the artists. He acted in their interest. Will Disc Makers carry the torch?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see. I wish the best to Derek and hope he appears again with a service that represents Portland and its emerging music economy.</p>
