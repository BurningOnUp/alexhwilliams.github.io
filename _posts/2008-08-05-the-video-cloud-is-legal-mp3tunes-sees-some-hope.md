<a href="http://www.michaelrobertson.com/">The Video Cloud Is Legal: MP3tunes Sees Some Hope</a><br/><p>Cablevision wins on appeal, providing susbcribers with an affordable Digital Video Recorder that gives them access to a server where they may acccess their video recordings. This storage locker concept may apply to <a href="https://shop.mp3tunes.com/myaccount/registration/">MP3tunes</a> which provides a similar service for audio files:</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.michaelrobertson.com">Michael Robertson</a>:</p>
<p>"The ruling set a definitive legal precedence for other responsibly run media storage and delivery services like MP3tunes. Just as with Cablevision&#8217;s <a href="http://michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=268">cloud</a> video service, media companies are <a href="http://michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=251">suing</a> my <a href="http://michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=268">cloud</a> music service making similar claims of copyright infringements and unauthorized public performances. Unlike Cablevision we are not doing any of the recording instead users are uploading their own music which we then play back only to them (no sharing, no anonymous access). It is a personal service with strict security measures in place since day one. This ruling won&#8217;t necessarily help Youtube and other one-to-many type of hosting services, but those true personal storage services should benefit mightily by the reasoned arguments rendered in the Cablevision case.&#8221;</p>
