Her phone is broken. She can only talk over speaker phone. Every time she calls I get this terrible beep in my ear. She calls to say the vines from the mounds in our garden are growing over the compost bins, climbing toward our bedroom window. It&#8217;s getting a bit creepy to see these vines getting closer to where we sleep. Are they attracted to snoring?</p>
