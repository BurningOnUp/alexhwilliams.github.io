<p>The <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/08/11/pr-less-launch-kicks-off-a-stack-overflow-of-praise/#comments">decision</a> to cover a company/story is entirely subjective. It&#8217;s about influence. How you influence bloggers and the media is the real question. In extension, it&#8217;s further about how your users influence the conversation.</p>
<p>I may just have to see if I can stop using email for anything but the most narrow of tasks. I will still use it to communicate with bloggers/media but sparingly as some like to be updated, others do not. My impression is that the up and coming bloggers do like to get email about stories. Anythng they can do to stay ahead or in pace with the tech blogosphere.</p>
<p>Email is also still the way I keep in touch with the mass majority of friends and family who have no clue about Twitter, etc. I do need to educate them better. Perhaps that is the answer.</p>
