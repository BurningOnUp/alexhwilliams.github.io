Very well done. We saw good friends and heard people tell the most revealing stories. How often do you get to hear a Portland Mercury editor tell you about his true colors. How he stole from Starbucks when working there in his younger days. How easy it looked for them to share so much. Great evening. I hope they post the video of the speakers.</p>
