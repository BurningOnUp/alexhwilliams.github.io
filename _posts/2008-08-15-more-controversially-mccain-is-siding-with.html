title: More controversially, McCain is siding with telecommunications companies over
  the issue of “net neutrality.” His policy, shaped by telco-friendly ex-Federal Communications
  Commission Michael Powell, would oppose laws that seek to regulate which users can
  use how much Internet bandwidth at what price. Obama has come down on the other
  side of the net neutrality issue, siding with those who believe the telcos’ ability
  to regulate Internet availability is monopolistic and hinders innovation.
