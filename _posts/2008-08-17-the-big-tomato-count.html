<p>The tomato count begins. Neighbor said: &#8220;You should count the tomatoes you pick. I bet you have 1,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>He may be correct. At season&#8217;s end, we tend to have target contests with those tomatoes rotten and not so great for eating. The result: lots of tomato plants in places you&#8217;d never expect.</p>
