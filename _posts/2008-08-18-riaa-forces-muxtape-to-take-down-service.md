<p>Muxtape is the service that lets people upload their music to share with other people. I liked the service but had little faith that they would last considering the hostile, no prisoner attitude of the RIAA.</p>
<p>Muxtape says on their site that their service will be back. But you have to wonder what it really means to come back when you have to sever your service.</p>
<p>Fred Von Lohman, senior intellectual property lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, did not have much faith  that Muxtape would last.</p>
<p>According to Webware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in April, my colleague Daniel Terdiman chatted with the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>'s senior intellectual property attorney, Fred von Lohmann, who said that a site like Muxtape was <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-9908164-52.html">only able to scrape by if it did not reach a critical mass</a>, and if it had good legal ground both in principle and on paper. We may be only beginning to see if the latter holds true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Webware also has a tidbit from the Muxtape <a href="http://muxtape.tumblr.com/">blog</a>. I am not sure what to make of the statement.  They&#8217;re either naive or trying to appeal tot heir community to take some kind of action. Most likely a mixture of both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No artists or labels have complained.  The site is not closed indefinitely.  Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
