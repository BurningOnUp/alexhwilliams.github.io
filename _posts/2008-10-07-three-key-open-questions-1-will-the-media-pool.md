title: 'Three key open questions: 1) Will the media pool choose to put their video
  of the debates in the public domain, so folks can freely blog key moments and share
  them without fear of being deemed a lawbreaker? 2) Will Tom Brokaw use some bottom-up
  debate questions collected and voted on on Googleâ€™s site, in addition or in place
  of the top-down ones the Commission collected? 3) Will the Commission adopt these
  principles for future debates, now that the candidates from both major parties embrace
  them?'
