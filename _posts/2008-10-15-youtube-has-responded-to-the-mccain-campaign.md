  that it can’t play favourites just because the senator is in the midst of an election
  campaign, and that while Mr. McCain no doubt thinks his clips are of extra importance,
  “there is a lot of other content on our global site that our users around the world
  find to be equally important.” Then comes the real zinger: YouTube’s general counsel
  Zahavah Levine says that: “We hope that as a content uploader, you have gained a
  sense of some of the challenges we face everyday in operating YouTube.” Bam.'
