Franz is CEO at <a href="http://www.concrete5.org">concrete5</a>, which offers an open source content management system.</p>
<p>Franz should know why billboard makers make lousy web site creators. Until recently, Franz did a lot of work with agencies. He developed all sorts of web sites, including one for <a href="http://www.kettlefoods.com">Kettle Foods</a> that won his company some nice <a href="http://concretethestudio.com/2005/04/18/concrete-cms-wins-award-for-kettle-foods-website/">kudos</a> back in the day.</p>
<p>Franz has pretty much stopped doing web site development work, trading it in for going open source with concrete5. You can get the concrete5 software for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/concretecms/">free</a>.</p>
<p>concrete5 offers a hosting package. You can also get the<a href="http://www.concrete5.org/index.php?cID=124"> c5 kit</a>. It comes with the hipster c5 stickers and a set of screwdrivers! Awesome. The USB drive is made of sustainable hardwood.</p>
<p>Damn. Open source. Sustainable hardwood. These guys are Portland through and through. Just wait until you see the orange VW Franz speeds away in at the end of the video. Now, talk about a sweet ride.</p>
