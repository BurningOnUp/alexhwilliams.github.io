<a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/reach-outside-your-fishbowl-to-build-community/">Reach Outside Your Fishbowl to Build Community | chrisbrogan.com</a><br/><p>Chris Brogan&#8217;s post is a good example of how Tumblr works for me and why I expect to use it more as a bookmarking tool.</p>
<p>Chris writes this post about reaching out beyond your community. Good advice.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I use Tumblr to reference the post:</p>
<p>I can easily click on the Tumblr bookmarklet I have in my browser and a window appears with a link to the title of the post that Chris wrote. I can post in a number of ways. I can write a text post. I can choose from a photo in the post. I can highlight a quote. In this case, I am using the default. The title of the post appears in a box. I can change it if I wish. The url appears in a second box.  I can click on a link to write a description, which I am doing here.</p>
<p>Once I post, I&#8217;ve set it up so <a href="htto://www.friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a> posts it to my profile. People may comment on my Tumblr or on FriendFeed.</p>
<p>I can now easily point people to the post. It&#8217;s a place where I know I can easily find it.</p>
<p>Isnt&#8217;t this what a bookmarking service is supposed to do?</p>
