  Antiguo y abandonado blog de Ricardo Galli :-( » WP-Cache 2.0
  WP-Cache makes loading pages faster and more responsve on yor Wordpress blog:
  "Worpress pages and storing them in a static file for serving future requests directly from the file rather than loading and compiling the whole PHP code and then building the page from the database. WP-Cache allows to serve hundred of times more pages per second, and to reduce the response time from several tenths of seconds to less than a millisecond."
