<p><img src="https://www.google.com/accounts/android-developer-minidroid.jpg" align="text-top" height="50" width="50"/>I attended an <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> developer <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1318090/">meetup</a> last night at the Lucky Lab in SE Portland.  I went to the meeting to learn more about Google&#8217;s mobile development platform and what the feeling is about its outlook.</p>
<p>The Android meetup had nine people in attendance. Last month, for the first meeting of the group, I am told about four people showed up. That does not seem like a big group but I bet this meetup to number 30 to 40 people within a few months.</p>
<p>I also have a hunch we will see a growing, regional interest in Android, perhaps most of all due to its open source nature and the calibre of talent that is already emerging.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, the mobile developers I spoke with last night are investing their development resources in Android. They also develop for the iPhone but recognize more opportunity with Android because it is open source. For this very reason, they expect the mobile phone application market to adopt Android at a quickening pace.</p>
<p>The Apple iPhone platform is more elegant than Android but the developers I spoke with attribute that to Android&#8217;s short time on the market.</p>
<p>I have some more to come tomorrow about the meetup and one particular Android application I saw for <a href="http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2008/09/portable_contac_1.html">Portable Contacts</a>, the Plaxo API for accessing address book, profile, and friends-list data.  It&#8217;s just too much to squeeze into one post.</p>
