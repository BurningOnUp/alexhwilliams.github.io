<p>Luke Lefler came over Tuesday morning to do an interview with me for his podcast: <a href="http://brokenhours.net/blog/?p=206">"Broken Hours."</a> We setttled in the basement and for the good part of an hour we rambled about podcasting, licensing and my latest interest, writing and recording songs. Afterwards, I played the song for him. He put it in the show. You can hear it at the 27:59 mark.</p>
<p>The song comes about following a recording session I did a few weeks ago with my good buddy, Brian Ingram. It&#8217;s called  &#8220;Hey, Mr. Bankerman.&#8221; It pokes a bit, I hope not with too many barbs, at the mess created by the financial industry.</p>
<p>My friends like it. Heh. You may find it awful. :-) I promise to come out with more.</p>
<p>As for Luke, the guy is a speedy editor and a sharp producer. When we first met, he talked about how much he loves the craft of podcasting. It shows. He turned the show around in less than a day. I like his editing style and look forward to chatting again on Broken Hours.</p>
