  Now, this looks cool. Doesn’t this seem like something people would want? Coolhunting writes:
  ”..wonderfully tactile keepsake, the Bob Books Flickbook takes your personal video clips and renders them as an old-fashioned pocket-sized flip book. The clever format makes for a fun way to share the ubiquitous videos shot on digital cameras and cell phones—both a curious novelty and a tangible document for the more ephemeral digital videos.”
  I am seeing more examples of this kind of business. It appears to me as a viable new way for the publishing and media worlds. It’s like this. People don’t buy albums, really, anymore. They don’t even buy single recordings for that matter. But what if a music publisher could appeal to the collector? Let them make their own CD. Fans could create a custom collection of music with photos, images, etc. It could be on a CD no less.
  I see no media group or music publisher taking this to scale. Further, this type of print on demand service seems like it has all kinds of uses for newspapers and any other group that publishes media. It turns what we post online into a tangible, collectible cool thing.
  This kind of thing gives customers a chance to create a craft. Let them express themselves through their own creations. Their resources are the media they produce and the work from the professional artist, musician, film maker and all the others whose creations are represented by the media group.
  flickr is embracing this idea. Reminds me…I need to make some moo cards.
