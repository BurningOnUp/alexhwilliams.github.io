  Mosaic reminds me of my first Internet job. I worked for aol in 1995, replying to feedback about the news people wanted. Sports. Sports. Sports. No fucking surprise there.
  What a crap job. I replied to 100 or more emails per night. I started to automate the replies. AOL said bullshit.Â  I needed to personalize my email responses. They paid me almost nothing.
  About that time, my buddy said I needed to get off that aol smack for some real web goodness. He pointed me to an ISP and showed me the 27 steps to set up an account. What a pain in the ass. Shit. But once I went through that goddam rabbit hole, I found about a million mad hatters just as wacko as me, tweaked just enough to love the speed of a 28 baud modem. What fucking bliss.
