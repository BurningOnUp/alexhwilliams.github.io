<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/2281932" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe><br/><p>Meet Sergei Goursky. He&#8217;s the CEO of <a href="http://www.subatomicstudios.com/">Sub Atomic Studios</a>, a video game development company here in Portland who I met during the <a href="http://alexhwilliams.com/post/59282825/portlands-open-source-culture-looks-fitting-for">Android meeting</a> I attended last week at Portland&#8217;s <a href="http://luckylab.com/">Lucky Lab</a> in Southeast Portland.  Goursky&#8217;s team are the game developers behind FieldRunners, the iPhone application that has received <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/10/21/review-fieldrunners-for-iphone-appeals-to-tower-defense-nerds">favorable reviews</a> and has quickly become a top ten seller on the iPhone store. (Boston Red Sox legend <a href="http://38pitches.com/2008/10/24/some-cool-stuff/">Curt Schilling</a> loves it, too, calling it a &#8220;helluva fun app.&#8221;)</p>
<p>I asked Goursky for his views about the future of Android. You may be surprised what he has to say.</p>
<p><b>Portland Code Trips</b></p>
<p>I am interviewing people in Portland who work in the Internet world.<a href="http://blog.unclenate.com/"> Nate DiNiro</a> and I hung out at Backspace in Old Town today. He came up with &#8220;Portland Code Trips.&#8221;  That certainly fits. Blog to come soon. I am also looking for music from local bands to feature.</p>
<p>I travel around town by bike and bus, <a href="http://blog.unclenate.com/">Flip camera</a> in my bag. It&#8217;s a road trip of sorts. My own little, local one that takes me to all the places a free geek may travel here in Portland, which is usually a coffee shop or pub. :-)</p>
<p>The geek scene is thriving in Portland. It&#8217;s an energy you can feel. Who do you know that does <b>not</b> love this town? My home is St. Johns. I ride the Peninsula to the other four quadrants. :-)</p>
<p>I love that and I know this place and its acccessibility gives the intellectually curious that same sense of happening. It&#8217;s happening in Portland like no other place. Architecture, food, the arts are all riding in plane with the geek energy. It&#8217;s intoxicating, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>My goal is to publish one video per day. We&#8217;ll see how I do. It&#8217;s an interview series with stories that I produce about the geeks who I discover here in Portland. I am not just talking about tech geeks. Portland has its share of food geeks, music geeks and all kinds of other folks who geek to their own beat. I hope I can bring that local geekery out just a little. In the meantime, expressing the zeitgeist of this time here in Portland, Oregon.</p>
