<p>I interviewed <a href="http://oakhazelnut.com/">Amber Case</a>, following a lecture she gave at the Pacific Northwest College of the Arts. We discuss art and how it crosses with cyborg culture. Amber is one of the few to join us on both journeys of the magic bus. She talks about the trips, our visits to local galleries and how it relates to cyborg anthropology.</p>
<p>Amber is producing <a href="http://cyborgcamp.org">Cyborg Camp</a> in Portland on Dec. 6. We&#8217;ll bring out the magic bus for the event. We&#8217;re looking for a sponsor to help pay for gas. Ping me if interested.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://staticphotography.com">Kris Krug,</a> <a href="http://chriskalani.com/">Chris Kalani</a> and <a href="http://chriskalani.com/">Dave Delaney</a> for use of the photos they shot of the magic bus and its merry band of travelers.</p>
