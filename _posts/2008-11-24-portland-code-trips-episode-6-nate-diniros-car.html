Definite feeling of the human tie to the machine. I know Nate as <a href="http://twtter.com/unclenate">@unclenate on Twitter</a>. That&#8217;s where I first ran into him. We live a few blocks away. So, we tend to find our way to local coffee shops and of course, our local watering hole&#8230;Leisure.<br/><br/>More wanderings with Nate tomorrow and why people recognize him as a <a href="http://www.mojohd.com/mojoseries/startupjunkies/">"start up junkie"</a> whenever he hits the road. The guy&#8217;s a rock star with an art car.</p>
