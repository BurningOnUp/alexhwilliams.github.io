<p>I did an interview last April with Hideshi Hamaguchi. He&#8217;s one of the founders of <a href="http://lunarr.com/index.jsp">lunarr</a> and one of the most creative people I have had the chance to meet here in Portland. He and his business partner developed Japan&#8217;s first intranet. At lunarr, their sites are on developing intuitive applications for the enterprise. If you get the chance, you should go to Portland&#8217;s <a href="http://cyborgcamp.org/">Cyborg Camp</a>. Hideshi is leading a session and may provide a peak of what they have been developing.</p>
<p>When we talked last April, Twitter had just <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2008/04/twitter-for-japan.html">launched</a> in Japan with a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-9926331-52.html">localized version</a>, developed by<a href="http://www.garage.co.jp/en/"> Digital Garage</a>. Twitter had already gained acceptance among the Japanese geek community. In the interview, Hideshi discusses how Japanese geeks reacted to the new version and why Twitter will be accepted in Japanese society. Just recently, Twitter Japan launched a<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_groups_delete.php">" groups,"</a> feature, the first of its kind in the world. Twitter has definitely established a beachhead in this critical Asian market.</p>
<p>This morning, in seeing how things had changed since April, I came across the summary of a report by <a href="http://www.mobileyouthsurvey.com/survey/twitter-mobile-youth-survey/">mobileYouth</a>. Their key finding showed that people 25 and younger now represent the heaviest Twitter users. According to mobileYouth, that trend is playing out in Japan, where &#8220;Japanese youth have rapidly adopted twitter into their daily social activities.&#8221;</p>
