<p>I saw that rainbow whirly ball and knew it was coming. iMovie crash. So.. the chat with Scott Kveton about bacon and the social stack will have to wait until tomorrow.</p>
<p>Instead, while out on my travels today I ordered a cup of tea at <a href="http://coffeeshopjournal.com/2008/05/29/blue-joe-coffee-lake-oswego-oregon-a-great-third-place/">Blue Joe Coffee</a>. Just check this out. I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it.</p>
