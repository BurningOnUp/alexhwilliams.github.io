The mood is just a bit different. It&#8217;s part information. part hardware and a kind of personal experience that brings machines more deeply into conversations about intelligence, information and human personality.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jazzpdx.org/">John Nastos</a> performed at CyborgCamp, playing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI">EWI</a>. The EWI is an electronic wind instrument that connects to a PC or Mac by cable or usb. Performers can edit the sounds, record straight to the computer or perform in a live setting, like at CyborgCamp.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely a cyborg style instrument. I felt it fitting to play the music to the Flickr photos I discovered with the tag <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=cyborgcamp&amp;w=all">"cyborgcamp."</a> Photo credits at the end of the video. :-)</p>
<p>Thanks again to Amber, Bram and everyone else who made CyborgCamp such a compelling event.</p>
