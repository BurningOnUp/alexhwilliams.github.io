<p>Wow. <a href="http://fredwilson.vc/">Fred Wilson</a> really goes on a <a href="http://twitter.com/fredwilson">"tweet rant"</a> about ATT and Apple. He said Apple is in partnership with &#8220;jerks.&#8221; He said that Apple is stupid for being in business exclusively with ATT.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s significant for a VC of such stature to go on such a tirade. Fred&#8217;s an influencer. His opinion counts.</p>
<p>I do not see it getting any less intense for Apple over the next 12 to 18 months, especially if criticism like this continues from people with similar influence in the community.</p>
