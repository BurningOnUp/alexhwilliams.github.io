<p>I&#8217;m in Corvallis today, right now at the <a href="http://www.allannbroscoffee.com/beaneries/2nd_street.cfm">Beanery</a>, one of my favorite coffee shops. I have some roots here so it&#8217;s always nice to return. I&#8217;m heading over to Oregon State University in a little bit. It&#8217;s 90 miles from St. Johns to Corvallis. If you leave by 6:30 am you can get here in about 90 minutes. That&#8217;s not too bad.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/121508-university-networking-labs.html?page=4">Network World</a> named OSU&#8217;s <a href="http://osuosl.org/">Open Source Lab</a> as one of the top ten coolest university networks in the United States. It&#8217;s one more example of why Oregon is without doubt recognized internationally for its open source culture. The designation is quite an accolade for Portland&#8217;s <a href="http://kveton.com/blog/">Scott Kveton</a>, who co-founded the Open Source Lab. Kveton is a bacon geek who also happens to be one of the leaders in the world of OpenID. ;)</p>
<p>I have some video of Scott talking about the &#8220;social stack&#8221; that I really need to post. I promise. :)</p>
<p>The Open Source Lab is in good company. University of California at Berkeley, Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University were also named.</p>
<p>Network World cited several reasons for naming OSU. The lab hosts a number of open source projects including the <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux kernel</a>, <a href="http://poena:9992/Rhythmyx/psx_ceArticle/www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> and the <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Network World also noted that the OSU Open Source Lab hosts the <a href="http://goscon.org/">Government Open Source Conference. </a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to get a tour of the Open Source Lab. Hope that happens today!</p>
