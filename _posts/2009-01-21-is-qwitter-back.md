<p><a href="http://useqwitter.com/">Qwitter</a> went dead over the holidays. I am wondering now if it has risen from the dead. Heh. Kind of like the social media zombies that <a href="http://www.fanboy.com/2009/01/social-media-experts-rant.html">Fanboy</a> wrote about? :)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what spooks me. I just received four emails from Qwitter notifying me of folks who have decided not to follow me anymore.  Actually, these are the first Qwitter messages I have ever received. I have a few theories here:</p>
<ol><li>Qwitter actually has risen from the dead and social media monsters are shunning me for my tweet that accused them of being thin skinned. </li>
<li>This is a spam scam created by some evil soul who knows how insecure I am about people unfollowing me. :)</li>
<li>Somehow, the new tweak to the Twitter API caused a jolt that gave life back to Qwitter. The Qwitter zombie lives!</li>
</ol><p>How does Qwitter relate to the new Twitter API? <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/is_twitter_strangling_its_api.php">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a>wrote today about the latest tempest about the now famous Twitter API and how it may affect services like Qwitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last night Twitter <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/bf65a7160a8a44c9/4ef285643a4079bf#4ef285643a4079bf">announced on its developer email list</a> that API calls from a single IP will be limited to 20,000 per hour. Desktop clients and services seeking only status updates won&#8217;t be affected, only services pinging Twitter over and over again for information like users&#8217; friends lists or other relatively unsupported data types will likely run up against the limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Twitter tweak means that services like Qwitter are pretty much kaput. So, what explains these Qwitter messages? <a href="http://www.contrast.ie/">Contrast</a>developed Qwitter, though you would never know it. There is not even a mention of Qwitter on their site.</p>
<p>My gosh - what zombie is at work here?</p>
<p>Update: I just saw on <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=qwitter">Twitter search</a> that users are also receiving email from Qwitter.</p>
