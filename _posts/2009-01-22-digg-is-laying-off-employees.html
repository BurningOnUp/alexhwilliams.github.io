<p><a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> is laying off employees. There is no confirmation on how many employees are getting cut but <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/01/22/digg-profitability/">Mashable</a> does say that Digg is reported to be laying off 10 percent of its staff. Jay Adelson writes in a <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=516">blog post</a> this morning the cuts will be made to the areas that are less core to the company mission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means we’ll be taking proactive measures to manage our costs including a headcount reduction in certain areas that are less core to this year’s objectives while continuing to hire for roles that will help build on our leadership position and get us to profitability faster. This includes hiring a direct sales team, in addition to other targeted hires in 2009.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>digg says they will focus on beefing up sales and its partnership with Microsoft and sponsor deals.</p>
<p>digg has developed its core technology. Developers will most likely feel the brunt of the cuts, imho.</p>
<p>This story is developing but is big news for startups everywhere as it again highlights the state of the tech economy. It also reflects on digg&#8217;s strategy over the past few years and how it will become profitable.</p>
