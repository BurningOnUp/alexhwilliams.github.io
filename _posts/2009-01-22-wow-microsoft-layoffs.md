<p><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1832&amp;tag=nl.e539">Mary-Jo Foley</a> writes that Microsoft is laying off 5,000 of its staff. Wow!</p>
<p>She quotes from the company’s Q2 earnings release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msft/earnings/FY09/earn_rel_q2_09.mspx">Microsoft will eliminate up to 5,000 jobs</a> in R&amp;D, marketing, sales, finance, legal, HR, and IT over the next 18 months, including 1,400 jobs today. These initiatives will reduce the company’s annual operating expense run rate by approximately $1.5 billion and reduce fiscal year 2009 capital expenditures by $700 million.”</p>
</blockquote>
