<p>I met Jon Maroney back in 2005 about when I did my first Podcast Hotel event. Jon had just started FreeRange. The company had developed an RSS reader for your mobile. The company has since morphed, now offering a mobile technology platform for media companies and major brands. It&#8217;s a branded reader, really.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Jon and the FreeRange team!</p>
