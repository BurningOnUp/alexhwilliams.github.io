<p>Congratulations, David and Marco — I guess this means we’ll have more office space soon.  I, for one, am looking forward to the happy day, about two to five years after the merger, when I’ll be able to log into Tumblr with my Yahoo! username.</p>

<p>It seems like my favorite services always end up on Yahoo! anyways. I love your fine style. If you can keep that with Yahoo! then I&#8217;d say don the purple robe, baby.</p>
