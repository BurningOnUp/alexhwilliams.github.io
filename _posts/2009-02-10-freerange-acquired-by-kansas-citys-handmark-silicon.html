<a href="http://">FreeRange acquired by Kansas City’s Handmark » Silicon Florist</a><br/><p><a href="http://siliconflorist.com/2009/02/09/freerange-acquired-by-kansas-citys-handmark/">http://siliconflorist.com/2009/02/09/freerange-acquired-by-kansas-citys-handmark/</a><br/><br/>Silicon Florist covered the FreeRange announcement. Rick notes accurately that FreeRange established an early presence in the mobile technology market. Their technology intersected just right with the interests of media companies and brands to provide a wrapper for services to their fast growing segment of customers who depend on their mobile devices throughout the work day.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s a shame that companies in the <a href="http://bit.ly/hnkF">enterprise RSS</a> market failed to execute on a similar strategy. it may have served them well.</p>
