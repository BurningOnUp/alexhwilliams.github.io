<p>A group of us had dinner a few weeks ago. <a href="http://chi.mp/s/carribugbee.mp">Carri Bugbee</a> said she would be in New York for a week. She was going to to the <a href="http://shortyawards.com/">Shorty Awards</a>. I wanted to know more. She said she could not say. A friend mentioned in a conversation a few days later that Carri was being really smart about Twitter.</p>
<p>I expected so. The Shorty Awards celebrated the best of Twitter. I saw a lot of competition. But I did not see her nominated. Huh?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that Carri Bugbee, at least on Twitter, is the persona of Peggy Olson, the character name of the &#8220;escapee from the secretary pool,&#8221; on the hit AMC series &#8220;Mad Men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, <a href="http://twitter.com/peggyolson">@peggyolson</a> has been a huge hit on Twitter. So much so that she came away with first place in the Shorty Awards for, of course, the advertising category.</p>
<p>To cap it off, Carri decided to make the ceremony her coming out party, where she revealed herself as @peggyolson. Apparently, she was the star of the show.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123439568330074869.html?mod=article-outset-box#project%3DSLIDESHOW08%26s%3DSB123438761056974359%26articleTabs%3Dslideshow">Wall Street Journal</a>, Carri devised the plan last August with two friends who took on the personalities of two other &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; characters: <a href="http://twitter.com/bettydraper">@bettydraper</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rogersterling">@rogersterling</a>. The three are now forming their own social media agency. According to the WSJ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All three of the &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; Twitterers revealed here are joining together, under the guidance of Ms. Bugbee, to form a social media consulting agency. Dubbed Supporting Characters, they hope to use what they have learned to make money helping companies use social media more effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. Carri is a star&#8230;and so is @peggyolson. :)</p>
