<p><img src="http://www.rsaconference.com/2009/us/images/poe.jpg" align="left" border="10" height="100" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100"/>The theme for the <a href="http://www.rsaconference.com">RSA</a> conference is Edgar Allen Poe. <a href="http://bit.ly/i8BBU">At first glance</a> I wondered why Poe would be the feature theme for the world&#8217;s largest tech security conference.</p>
<p>After further reading, it makes a lot of sense. Cryptography is a hallmark of Internet security. Poe treated cryptography in his journalism and fiction. In his day, he was admired as muh for his writing as his cryptographic skills.</p>
<p><b>“The most profound and skillful cryptographer who ever lived”<br/><br/><i style="font-size: 10px;">– Massachusetts Clergyman on Poe</i></b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the Dartmouth professor angle that makes Poe&#8217;s legacy even more interesting. In I839, Poe challenged &#8220;his readers to submit their ciphers to him, asserting that he would solve them all.&#8221; He solved all the ciphers. He then made a new challenge to his reader, offering a magazine subscription if they could solve the ciphers submitted by Mr. W. B. Tyler, praising the author as a “gentleman whose abilities we highly respect.”</p>
<p>No one ever solved the ciphers until 1995 when Professor Louis Renza announced his own theory about the ciphers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There the ciphers remained until 1985 when Professor Louis Renza of Dartmouth College suggested that Tyler was actually a double for Poe himself. Renza’s theory was later elaborated by Shawn Rosenheim in his book <i>The Cryptographic Imagination: Secret Writing from Edgar Allan Poe to the Internet.</i> In it, Rosenheim points to the likelihood that the ciphers were placed in the magazine by Poe himself as a final challenge to his readers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It just goes to show that the most effective cryptography achieves its success through the power of the individual more than anything else.</p>
<p>And Poe was one powerful individual. His legacy still remains paramount, even after 170 years.</p>
