<p>It reminds me of what Rusty Hodge of <a href="http://soma.fm">soma.fm</a> said a few weeks back. He likes receiving the CD, especially the art that goes with it. You can tell something about the recording when an artist takes the time to create something for you. Email just makes it too easy for artists to spam you with their recordings.</p>
<p>Is this service better? I love the art that goes with CD cases from indie artists but for efficiency, a service like SoundCloud looks pretty enticing.</p>
