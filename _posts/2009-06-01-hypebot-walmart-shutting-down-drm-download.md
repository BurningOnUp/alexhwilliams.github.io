<p>Another DRM service is going away. Walmart is dropping its DRM download service. Customers are being told to burn their music to CD&#8217;s.</p>
<p>WalmartÂ  will not support the service, which is in contrast to iTunes and others.</p>
<p>According to Hypebot:</p>
<p><i>iTunes offered an paid upgrade to mp3&#8217;s after it made the DRM-free transition and still supports the tracks it sold with DRM. Other download services like Napster and Rhapsody were forced to extend their transitions after complaints from consumers. </i></p>
