  Doc Searls Weblog Â· #Cluetrain @10
  Tenth Anniversary of the ClueTrain Manifesto web site is here, the book later this year. Talk with Doc Searls at Harvard this week. And I am going to be in Boston with the family. A family event? Not likely.
  New edition cover has a distinct difference. In the old edition, cluetrain cover is all lower case letters. New edition - CLUETRAIN is all upper case. Upper case letters for Cluetrain seems odd. But I guess this is book publisher marketing more than anything.
