  Our day trip to Boston took us to the ICA for the Shepard Fairey exhibit, a tour of the Harvard campus and a most excellent journey to find a skate shop for Daniel.
  Here’s the photo set.
  The day started just right. Peter Vanderwarker is my cousin. He’s perhaps Boston’s most well known architectural photographer. Peter did the photogrpahy for the ICA. We wre driving there and Peter said that maybe we can get in free, since he did take the photos. He suggested I buy a postcard and make my pitch. It worked. We got in free. Great start to a great day.
