<p>I received an email from Google this morning. Looks like Google Voice may be worth a try. I never did give Grand Central a chance. Maybe it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t talk on the phone nearly as muh as I once did? Looks like they are offering SMS. Okay, I am going into experimentation mode with this one.</p>
<p>I read the email.Â  Why? It came from Google. They never send promotional email. It caught my attention. Lesson: Send an email to your customers like once every ten years. People will read it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re emailing you today to let you know you should upgrade your account to Google Voice.<br/><br/> GrandCentral is now Google Voice. We also added the following features: SMS, voicemail transcripts, conference calling and low-priced international calls.<br/><br/> As we focus our development efforts on Google Voice, we require that you upgrade to Google Voice now in order to continue using your number.
