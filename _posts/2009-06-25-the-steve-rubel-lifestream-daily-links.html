  The Steve Rubel Lifestream - Daily links, insights, photos, videos and more on emerging technology trends.
  Steve Rubel is using Posterous for his new lifestream, which he says is replacing his blog.
  I use Tumblr and love it. I started with the service soon after it launched. Switched my domain there and have not looked back.
  So, Steve, why Posterous?
  I can use Tumblr to do what Posterous does with the exception of built in comments. I recall Tumblrâ€™s founder saying how he did not believe a lifestream should have comments baked in. I wonder if he still believes that. It was easy enough to add Disqus, though, a bona fide comment system that can integrate with Twitter.
