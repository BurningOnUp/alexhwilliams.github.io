  skate ramp (via alexhwilliams)
  Theyâ€™re making a channel gap: two ramps that face each other. Each ramp has a top edge for launching and turns. Dudes are getting ready for an event here in Portland next week. NE 20th, near Sandy. One of the guys said he is with ESPN. Seeing how event goes and then hoping to bring it to LA.
