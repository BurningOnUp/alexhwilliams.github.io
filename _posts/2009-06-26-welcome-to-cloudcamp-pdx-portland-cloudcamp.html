   Welcome to CloudCamp PDX (Portland) » CloudCamp
  Four reasons why you should go to CloudCamp Portland:
  - You need to get a picture of what makes cloud computing attractive compared to current client/server practices
  - Cloud computing’s power to compute large data sets foreshadows a fundamental change in business practices
  - Cloud computing is very affordable. It makes more sense in a world of web and mobile applications
  - Catering by Nicholas: Kabobs, baba ganouah, baklava and a number of other Middle Eastern dishes. Talk cloud computing and enjoy some really great food.
  Hope to see you Tuesday.
