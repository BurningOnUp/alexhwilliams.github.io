  RIAA Seeks Web Removal of ‘Illegal’ Court Recordings | Threat Level | Wired.com
  Harvard’s Charles Nesson is getting the RIAA all worked up. 

  He uses Twitter for court proceedings. He records discussions. He uses them in class.
  And for this, the RIAA says, he may be committing a felony.
  “That is so outrageously unconstitutional that I would prefer myself to honor the United States Constitution and take my chances that recording a conversation with a judge in a federal case and opposing lawyers is somehow in violation of a Massachusetts statute that makes me a felon,” Nesson said.
  Nesson, who has attempted but so far failed to get the upcoming trial and pretrial proceedings webcast, said the lawsuit’s proceedings should be in the public domain.
  “I’m opening it up,” he said. “That’s what I founded the Berkman Center to fight for.”
