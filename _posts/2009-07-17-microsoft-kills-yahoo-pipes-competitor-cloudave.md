  Microsoft Kills Yahoo Pipes Competitor | CloudAve
  Ever more a need for an open source version of Yaoo! Pipes?
  First it was Google Mashup Editor and, now, Microsoft’s Popfly and I hope Yahoo Pipes stay in the game. With Yahoo Pipes, the impact will be much more severe than Popfly as many people have taken advantage of Yahoo Pipes to optimize their workflow.
