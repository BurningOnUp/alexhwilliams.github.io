  I think that’s why I like what you are doing Dave. You are focusing on the real problem which is Twitter or any centralized engine/store being the global short messaging king… the source of the pulse etc. Compuserve could never have been THE Email Utility for the same reasons. So rssCloud is an effort to decentralize this madness using existing standards/tech/code/methods and not getting drunk on the notion of “faster mechanisms” that have existed for a decade+ anyway.

  Even Scoble admits that his real-time screen-staring sessions have limited value and has been looking for more intimacy. Quality vs. Quantity. Nobody is asking for this real-time movement. It’s limelighting and shortsighting.
