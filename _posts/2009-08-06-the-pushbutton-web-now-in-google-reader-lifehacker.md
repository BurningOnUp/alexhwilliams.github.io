<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5331165/the-pushbutton-web-now-in-google-reader">The Pushbutton Web Now in Google Reader - Lifehacker</a><br/><p>I listened to Anil Dash discuss the <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/07/the-pushbutton-web-realtime-becomes-real.html">"push button web"</a> on <a href="http://badhair.us/2009/07/31/00025.html">Bad Hair Day</a> with <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> and <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/02/21/daveWinerBio.html">Dave Winer</a>. What Anil describes relates in many respects to <a href="http://rsscloud.org">RSSCloud</a>, the effort Dave has been working on as of late.</p>
<p>So it is of note that a push button web is now available in Google Reader, using the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pubsubhubbub">PubSubHubbub protocol</a>.</p>
<p>This is real-time RSS and ushers in a whole new world of real time updating.</p>
<p>Twitter has a lot of control. Almost too much. But it can&#8217;t last forever, especially with cloud services providing the foundation for users to create their own real-time updating tools.</p>
