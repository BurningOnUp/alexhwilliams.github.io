  MacForce SummerBlast 2009
  I volunteered some time yesterday at MacForce Summer Blast to talk with folks about Twitter. Really, what the hell else is there to talk about?
  One woman did have some questions about the MacBook she and her husband bought in January. They had not used it because she said they did not know how. Six months they went without using their brand new computer!
  She said her husband did not want to use it until he read all the manuals.
  But just a few days ago they finally connected it to the Internet and thought it mght be a good time to figure out how to use the machine.
  I showed her iTunes. I thought it would give them some enjoyment and perhaps spur them on. We walked through how to set the laptop up with their speakers. We walked through how to load applications. Very basic.
  It was a great reminder for me how little people really know about tech. Even though I am not a technical guy, I can show people how to use a Mac! Ha. :)
