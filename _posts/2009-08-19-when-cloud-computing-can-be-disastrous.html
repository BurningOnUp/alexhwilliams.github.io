It&#8217;s like trying to look at something out a window when you don&#8217;t really even know what you&#8217;re trying to see. Mix in the novelty factor and the view looks more like a bunch of hot air balloons ready to pop. How the view would improve with a little clarity and understanding.</p>
<p><a href="#mce_temp_url#">Charlton Barreto</a> provides a good example of what happens when there is not a level set view on what the hell a group wants to do about cloud computing.</p>
<p>Poor decisions are inevitable when the level of knowledge about cloud computing is so thin and the novelty factor is pulsating like a malformed, swelling red balloon. Add on top of that what Charlton describes and the results can be disastrous.</p>
