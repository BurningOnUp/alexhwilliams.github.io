title: My use of social media and my career advancement are intrinsically tied," Owyang
  told us by phone today. "I started my blog as a practitioner at Hitachi. I budget
  time every morning to read and blog. I do that before I check my personal email
  or work email. I believe you have to pay yourself first. When you open your email
  you pay someone else, because it’s usually people reaching out to ask you for something.
  Taking the time to read blogs, synthesize and add value, that builds your community.
  That’s paying yourself first.
