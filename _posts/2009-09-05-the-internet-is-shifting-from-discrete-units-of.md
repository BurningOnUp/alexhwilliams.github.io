title: The Internet is shifting from discrete units of websites and Web pages to discrete
  units of information (e.g. people, organizations, articles and videos, product offerings,
  store listings, and blog posts) and associated meta data (e.g. images, addresses,
  reviews, ratings) that move seamlessly around the Web, being slotted where appropriate.
  These units of information can be organized in ways that are relevant and personal
  to each individual, using data gleaned from social graphs as well as recommendation
  and personalization services that allow users to set their preferences.
