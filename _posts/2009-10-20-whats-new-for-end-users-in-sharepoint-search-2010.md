<a href="http://www.sharepointchick.com/archive/2009/10/19/whatrsquos-new-for-end-users-in-sharepoint-search-2010.aspx">What’s new for end users in SharePoint Search 2010</a><br/><p>Part of what I do in my work is look at a lot of different sources when working on a blog post for <a href="http://readwriteweb.com/enterprise">ReadWriteWeb</a>. Here is where I will add these links. I&#8217;ve gone directly to Delicious in the past but I am finding my own blog is as good a place as any to index the links that I run across.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for my own reference as much for you. Hope you find these links useful.</p>
