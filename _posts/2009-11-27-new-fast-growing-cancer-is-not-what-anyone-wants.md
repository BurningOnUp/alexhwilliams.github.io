title: New, fast-growing cancer is not what anyone wants in my body, but I can’t say
  it’s unexpected, or a genuine surprise. This is how cancer often goes. Treatments
  work, sometimes better, sometimes worse—and then sometimes they stop working. It’s
  always a fight, and one I might lose. My wife and children and parents and family
  and friends are sad. My head is swimming with thoughts of all sorts. Time to walk
  into the unknown future again.
