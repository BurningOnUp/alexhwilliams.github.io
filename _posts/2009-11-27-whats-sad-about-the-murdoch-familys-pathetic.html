title: What’s sad about the Murdoch family’s pathetic mewling about Google as if it
  were a big, bad bully kicking sand in their face and their desperate, cliff-grabbing
  speculation about pay walls is that neither is a big bet. Neither shows any vision.
  Neither shows balls. That’s why I have no faith in the argument that Yoda – or Jabba
  the Murdoch, if you prefer – has one more up his sleeve. No, son James Murdoch just
  said News Corp isn’t a news corp anymore but a TV company. They’ve given up. They’re
  just hoping to squeeze one more pint of milk out of old Bessie before they turn
  her into fajitas.
