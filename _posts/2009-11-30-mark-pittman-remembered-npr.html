<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120963360">Mark Pittman Remembered : NPR</a><br/><p>If you knew Mark Pittamn, you will recognize the outrage in his voice that you hear in this story about him on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120963360">NPR</a>.</p>
<p>He was that kind of reporter. He had passion. He fought for what he believed was right. He tore into the mid-Hudson Valley where we both worked for the Times Herald-Record back in the mid-1990s. And just like on the police beat, Mark tore into Wall Street. In the end, just before his death last week, Mark and Bloomberg won their lawsuit against the Feds for the details on the bank bail outs.</p>
<p>Mark kicked ass. He always did. That&#8217;s how I will remember him. A kick ass reporter who loved to take on the biggest game he could find.</p>
<p>Mark reminded us all that nothing is too sacred. Always question authority and share what you learn.</p>
<p>The impacts can be tremendous.</p>
