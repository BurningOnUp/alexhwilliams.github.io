title: 'What does this mean for us? There’s no doubt that employees are in for a fair
  amount of change. With $1.28B in FY08 sales, Gartner is about 32 times our size.
  It has more than 650 analysts to our 40, and 1,000 sales reps compared to 45 for
  us. It has operations in 80 countries, while we’re in the United States and the
  UK. Is bigger better? While I haven’t worked for a $1B+ company in 25 years, there
  are several facets of Gartner I find very appealing: * We will be writing to a much
  larger audience. For example, First Thing Monday has the largest subscription base
  of all of our publications. Many of the 32,000 subscribers who received the most
  recent edition get it as a free publication. While we’re proud of that base, Gartner
  has nearly twice as many paying clients. * We will have a stronger global reach.
  While my AMR Research tenure has allowed me to amass nearly 3.4 million American
  Airlines miles from business travel to six continents, we were never very successful
  in building a global presence. Although we have global clients, we could never provide
  them true local support. Gartner, by contrast, has operations everywhere. * We will
  be in more verticals. We have a strong presence in discrete and process manufacturing,
  consumer products, life sciences, and retail, but that’s pretty much it. This will
  change. For example, as part of our sustainability coverage, I look forward to talking
  to executives in utilities and public sector about their roles and involvement.
  * We will have access to more research assets. Because of our size, we often had
  a single analyst or two covering an important emerging software or services market.
  We now have 650 new research peers to stimulate our thinking and challenge our ideas.
  * It’s all about the written word. In my first meeting with a Gartner executive
  a few weeks ago, I asked about metrics for research. He told me that his firm places
  a strong emphasis on high-quality writing. It was exactly what I hoped he’d say.
  As you can surmise, I plan to stay with Gartner and reach a much broader audience.
  While it will be a bit odd not to have the Advanced Manufacturing Research or AMR
  Research logos grace my business cards and PowerPoint templates, at least I will
  never again be introduced as being from “American Market Research” or “ARM.” Everyone
  knows Gartner.'
