<blockquote>
<p>Having implemented virtualization software to conquer &#8220;server sprawl&#8221; (or, more specifically, to perform more work on fewer servers and thus minimize the proliferation of servers), many Wall Street firms are now in the throes of &#8220;virtual sprawl.&#8221; This panicky term refers to the condition in which IT managers and, in some cases, even end users have been installing virtual machines all over the organization, creating a chaotic mess that is hard to manage.</p>
