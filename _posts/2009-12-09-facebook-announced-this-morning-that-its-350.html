title: Facebook announced this morning that its 350 million users will be prompted
  to make their status messages and shared content publicly visible to the world at
  large and search engines. It’s a move we expected but the language used in the announcement
  is near Orwellian. The company says the move is all about helping users protect
  their privacy and connect with other people, but the new default option is to change
  from “old settings” to becoming visible to “everyone.”
