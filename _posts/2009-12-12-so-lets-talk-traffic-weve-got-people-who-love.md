title: So let’s talk traffic. We’ve got people who love this goddamn phone so much
  that they’re living on it. Yes, that’s crushing your network. Yes, 3% of your users
  are taking up 40% of your bandwidth. You see this as a bad thing. It’s not. It’s
  a good thing. It’s a blessing. It’s an indication that people love what we’re doing,
  which means you now have a reason to go out and double or triple or quadruple your
  damn network capacity. Jesus! I can’t believe I’m explaining this to you. You’re
  in the business of selling bandwidth. That pipe is what you sell. Right now what
  the market is telling you is that you can sell even more! Lots more! Good Lord.
  The world is changing, and you’re right in the sweet spot.
