<p>I went through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene">Graham Greene</a> phase back in my teen years and early twenties. I did not know that he also had his hand in film. Tonight, the NW Film Center is showing Brighton Rock as part of its &#8220;<a href="http://www.nwfilm.org/screenings/22/212/#1425">Best of British Film Noir,&#8221;</a> series.</p>
<p>Greene wrote the novel and the screenplay for the film.</p>
<p>Fron the NW Film Center:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The brilliant author Graham Greene provides the source novel and screenplay for this Dickensian glimpse into the underbelly of a typical British seaside resort, where sun, sand, and carnivals camouflage another town entirely. In run-down Brighton, the boardwalk is lined with pasty day-trippers and incompetent singing acts and patrolled by teenage Napoleon &#8216;Pinkie&#8217; Brown (Richard Attenborough). With a choirboy’s looks and a killer’s cold stare, as alien to his fellow gangsters as he is to &#8216;civilians,&#8217; Attenborough embodies a psychosis matched only by James Cagney in WHITE HEAT.”—Pacific Film Archive. “One of the finest British thrillers ever.”—Time Out, London.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><p>The film starts at 7&#160;pm tonight at the Whitsell in the <a href="http://www.portlandartmuseum.org/">Portland Art Museum</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re heading out for sushi and then to the film. Kind of a perfect date night.</p>
