  cyborg landscapes: BedZED
  "Bed ZED (Beddington zero energy development) was designed by architect Bill Dunster. There are 82 houses, 17 apartments and 1,405 m2 of workshop space.Â Everything is aligned for maximum solar gain, there is a central heating and power system that uses waste wood and waste water is recycled through the system below."
  There is a BedZED car sharing club and the layout is intended to be walking and cycling friendly, with easy access to public transport.
