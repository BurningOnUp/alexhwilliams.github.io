title: Hate groups stayed at record levels — almost 1,000 — despite the total collapse
  of the second largest neo-Nazi group in America. Furious anti-immigrant vigilante
  groups soared by nearly 80%, adding some 136 new groups during 2009. And, most remarkably
  of all, so-called “Patriot” groups — militias and other organizations that see the
  federal government as part of a plot to impose “one-world government” on liberty-loving
  Americans — came roaring back after years out of the limelight.
