<p>A letter appeared this morning when I signed into <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a>. The letter covers Quora&#8217;s terms of service, which it did not have when I started using the service:</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t have a terms of service ready when you registered for Quora, so we need you to approve it now.<br/>We designed the terms of service to be as advantageous as possible to writers and sharers. The basics are:<br/>You own all the content you write on Quora, period. You can put it on your blog, e-mail it to your friends, modify it, publish it in a book, etc., whatever you want.<br/>When you write something on the site, you give permission to Quora to show it to other users.<br/>By default, people can copy and paste your answer from the site to anywhere on the web as long as they link back to your original answer. If you don&#8217;t want this for something specific, you can leave a note on your answer saying that permission isn&#8217;t granted for that content.<br/>These are what we think are the most important things from the terms, but if you&#8217;re interested in the details, you should read the entire Terms of Service.<br/><br/>Â I agree to the Terms of Service<br/><br/>If you have any questions or concerns, you can email us at info@quora.com.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>The Quora Team</p>
