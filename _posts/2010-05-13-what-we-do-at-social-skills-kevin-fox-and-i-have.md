  What We Do at Social Skills
  Kevin Fox and I have developed a suite of social Web tools for public relations firms, marketing agencies and businesses.
  For example, our clients use our “Press Hits,” blog format to provide a record of media mentions for sales and marketing purposes.
  One client credited their Press Hits blog for landing a distribution deal with one of the largest US retailers in the sports apparel market.
  We also develop brand aggregators, social network update workflows and blog sites.
  Would you be interested in a demo?
  Please contact us for more information. :)
