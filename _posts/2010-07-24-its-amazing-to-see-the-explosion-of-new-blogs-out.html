title: It’s amazing to see the explosion of new blogs out there focused on landscape
  and urbanism - which is a testament to the power of the media in allowing for a
  multitude of voices. Some have emerged and gone quickly away… others have grown
  in readership and voice. Whereas traditional media is often lacking (or at least
  less timely), the web allows easy startup, low-cost, and minimal editorial interference…
  making everyone their own publisher. While this is great, it’s also created a somewhat
  disconnected conversation depending on your desires… and also creates significant
  work to maintain a wide net.
