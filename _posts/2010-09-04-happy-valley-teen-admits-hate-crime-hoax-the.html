<p>The sheriff&#8217;s office inÂ Clackamas County, Or. said how sorry the kid is about what he did. But what about the family that was taunted? Can you believe what the sheriff&#8217;s office said about it all?</p>
<p><em><span>"It has been determined there is no actual threat or hatred that exists &#8212; It is, and remains a Happy Valley," deputies said.</span></em></p>
<p>Happy Valley - where the kids taunt their neighbors with racist threats.</p>
<p>That sure is one friendly place - Happy Valley!</p>
