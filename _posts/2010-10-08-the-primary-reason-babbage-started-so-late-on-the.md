title: The primary reason Babbage started so late on the Analytical Engine was that
  he was building up experience and knowledge prior to being 42 that led to its invention.
  He had started working on the Difference Engine No. 1 in 1822 (aged 31) and ideas
  for the Analytical Engine (such as the barrel based micro-programming and loops)
  came from trying to solve the problems associated with the Difference Engine.
