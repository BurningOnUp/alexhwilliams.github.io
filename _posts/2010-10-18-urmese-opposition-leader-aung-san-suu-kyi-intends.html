title: urmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi intends to start tweeting once she
  is released from house arrest in order to communicate with the younger generation,
  her lawyer said today. The Nobel laureate has been in prison or under house arrest
  for 15 of the past 21 years but her current detention is due to end on 13 November.
  Analysts believe her sentence was designed to keep the 65-year-old locked away during
  Burmaâ€™s first election in 20 years, scheduled for 7 November.
