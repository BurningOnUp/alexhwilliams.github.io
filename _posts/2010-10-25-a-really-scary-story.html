<p>After the IBM opening this morning, I left through a ground floor entrance. Everyone else climbed the arena stairs. I did not want to climb the stairs. I found an elevator and took it to the third floor. IT WAS REALLY DARK AND QUIET UP THERE. IT WAS KIND OF SCARY.</p>
<p>I wandered for what seemed like miles. I took an elevator to the first floor.</p>
<p>I live another day.</p>
