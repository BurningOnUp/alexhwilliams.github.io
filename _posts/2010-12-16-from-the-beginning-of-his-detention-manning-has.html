title: 'From the beginning of his detention, Manning has been held in intensive solitary
  confinement. For 23 out of 24 hours every day — for seven straight months and counting
  — he sits completely alone in his cell. Even inside his cell, his activities are
  heavily restricted; he’s barred even from exercising and is under constant surveillance
  to enforce those restrictions. For reasons that appear completely punitive, he’s
  being denied many of the most basic attributes of civilized imprisonment, including
  even a pillow or sheets for his bed (he is not and never has been on suicide watch).
  For the one hour per day when he is freed from this isolation, he is barred from
  accessing any news or current events programs. Lt. Villiard protested that the conditions
  are not “like jail movies where someone gets thrown into the hole,” but confirmed
  that he is in solitary confinement, entirely alone in his cell except for the one
  hour per day he is taken out. In sum, Manning has been subjected for many months
  without pause to inhumane, personality-erasing, soul-destroying, insanity-inducing
  conditions of isolation similar to those perfected at America’s Supermax prison
  in Florence, Colorado: all without so much as having been convicted of anything.
  And as is true of many prisoners subjected to warped treatment of this sort, the
  brig’s medical personnel now administer regular doses of anti-depressants to Manning
  to prevent his brain from snapping from the effects of this isolation.'
