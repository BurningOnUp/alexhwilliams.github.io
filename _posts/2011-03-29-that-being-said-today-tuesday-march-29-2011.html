title: That being said, today, Tuesday March 29, 2011 there is a great reason to try
  a new restaurant. MercyCorps and a whole list of restaurants are participating in
  Dine out Portland. Not only will you be supporting the local economy and restaurants,
  but the restaurants are donating all or a portion of their proceeds to MercyCorps
  relief effort for Japan. So, today is the perfect time to take your wife, girlfriend,
  or even buddy out for a great meal at a new restaurant. I can’t think of a better
  reason to sneak out of the house and enjoy a night in Portland.
