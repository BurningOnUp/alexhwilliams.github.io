<p>So I have some big news.</p>
<p>After five incredible years at CNET, I’m moving on. May 6 is my last day; ten days later, I will join Google’s New York office as a member of its fledgling Trends &amp; Insights team. I’ll be doing a lot of writing, editing, and analysis as I work with <a href="http://twitter.com/allimooney">Alli Mooney</a> to&#8230;</p>
