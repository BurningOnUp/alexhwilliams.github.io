  The Fellowship
  A visualization of the journey of the Fellowship in The Lord of the Rings movie trilogyâ€”directed by Peter Jackson and adapted from the original books by J.R.R. Tolkien.
  It synthesizes which characters are with each other and where they are geographically on a time line, and also highlights major events in the plot along the way. The visual style was inspired by 19th century typography and design.
