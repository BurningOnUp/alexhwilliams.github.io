<p>After 18 months at <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a>, I&#8217;ve decided to move on to a new job covering enterprise for <a href="http://siliconangle.com">SiliconAngle</a>, the fast growing blog and video network founded by<a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/author/john/"> John Furrier</a> and now closely aligned with <a href="http://wikibon.org/">Wikibon</a>, co-founded by<a href="http://wikibon.org/wiki/v/David_Vellante_member_spotlight"> David Vellante</a>. The decision did not come without a bit of heartache. I loved the work at ReadWriteWeb, building <a href="http://readwritweb.com/cloud">RWCloud</a>, <a href="http://readwritweb.com/enterprise">RWEnterprise</a> and <a href="http://readwritweb.com/hack">RWHack</a>.</p>
<p>These channels grew significantly for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul><li>ReadWriteWeb is an institution. I feel honored to have had the chance to work there. RWW&#8217;s credibility provided the channels with a foundation for success.</li>
<li>Rapid change in the enterprise. Let&#8217;s see&#8230;big data; the API movement; mobile; platforms - the list goes on.</li>
<li>Disruption. Blogs continue to disrupt. The IT media world is not immune. The media landscape is changing.</li>
<li>Developers. To borrow from <a href="http://redmonk.com">RedMonk</a>, developers are the new kingmakers.</li>
</ul><p>My new role at SiliconAngle will mean a few things:</p>
<ul><li>Launching new initiatives to better cover the enterprise world.</li>
<li>Curating, curating, curating.</li>
<li>More researching and writing. There&#8217;s a deeper analyst role in the work.</li>
<li>Video - Have you seen <a href="http://siliconangle.tv">The Cube</a>?</li>
<li>Out in the community - getting to events, bringing The Cube, covering the space.</li>
</ul><p>I especially want to thank:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/author/richard-macmanus.php">Richard MacManus</a>, the visionary founder of ReadWriteWeb.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/about_sean.php">Sean Ammirati</a> - who I can&#8217;t say enough about in his role at ReadWriteWeb.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFoQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.readwriteweb.com%2Fabout_marshall.php&amp;ei=ZqDuTevkII6qsAPMzZWABw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-wybS4Zdniq5zaSJmZO45pcyqOQ">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> - A leader in the new world of journalism but most of all a good friend.</li>
<li>My colleague, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/author/klint-finley.php">Klint Finley</a>, who writes most of the RWEnterprise and RWHack posts. Klint is one to watch. He&#8217;s just getting started. </li>
<li>All the smart analysts, bloggers and executives who I&#8217;ve come to know over the past 18 months.</li>
</ul><p>I am now doing a lot of research and will start to write soon. But the most significant efforts will come in the weeks ahead when we launch our first initiative.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep you posted. :)</p>
