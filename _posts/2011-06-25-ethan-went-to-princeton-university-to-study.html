title: Ethan went to Princeton University to study philosophy - his senior thesis
  was “Two Views of Wittgenstein’s Later Philosophy.” Prior to graduating, Ethan left
  school and had to reapply for admission. But he was late in submitting his forms,
  prompting the school to deny re-entry. Ever the prankster, Ethan - with help from
  Joel - wrote a letter to the school with the wild claim that he had lost his arm
  in a hunting accident. The dean replied to say that he was sorry to hear about his
  arm and that Ethan should send a letter from his doctor saying whether or not he
  could attend classes. Ethan decided to push the envelope, writing a letter from
  the Reverend Doctor Samson Gaziorwitz of Our Lady of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat
  Hospital. The letter claimed that Ethan had also lost his legs and should be scheduled
  for classes close together. It went on to suggest that it would be wise for the
  school to warn fellow students wishing to poke fun that Ethan had “become quite
  adept at wielding his hooks.” (The Washington Post, Feb. 3, 1985) The school demanded
  that Ethan submit himself to psychological examination, which he passed with flying
  colors.
