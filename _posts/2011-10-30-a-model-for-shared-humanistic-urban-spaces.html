  A model for shared, humanistic urban spaces? Perhaps this is the answer. Okay, fine, times are tough. But in return, should not our governments be investing in new, humanistic spaces that serve as places for us to share and maybe even provide healthcare, education and other services?
  The Occupy Wall Street movement may be that catalyst. These spaces people are occupying - can we develop an infrastructure out of these that fulfill our ancestral need for a humanistic society?
