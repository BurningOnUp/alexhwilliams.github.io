  Heat a non-stick skillet to medium low heat.Lightly spray with oil.  Slice an avocado with the skin ON lengthwise, forming one thick slice in  the middle. Remove the seed and use a small cookie cutter to  make a hole in the center of your thick slice. Place the avocado slice  in the pan. Crack a medium sized egg into the center of the hole. Cover  and cook for a minute or two, until the egg is as you like it. Season  with salt and pepper and serve.

  This just changed my life.

  Um.  Yours and mine.  Making tomorrow.
  I haven’t had this yet but it’s now my favorite food in the whole world.
