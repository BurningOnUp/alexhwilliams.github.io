  My friend Brent Van Wieringen is on a road trip, thinking about life as a 37-year-old. I am here thinking of my life as a 47-year-old. Doesn’t feel much different except I know these past 10 have been a swirl of happiness, sadness and everything in between. I think somewhere in there I learned to take care of myself. It’s the best thing I could have done for me and the ones I love.
  So, good luck, Brent. Safe travels. :)
