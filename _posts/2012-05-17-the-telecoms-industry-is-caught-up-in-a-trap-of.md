title: The telecoms industry is caught up in a trap of its own making driven by a
  failed mental model of networks as pipes, bandwidth as the resource that is to be
  packaged and sold, and resource efficiency as the driver of profit. The inevitable
  result is that the typical telco resembles a Model T car plant (complete with QoS
  mine, network policy plantation and IMS steelworks), rather than a modern lean flexible
  manufacturing system matching resources to needs quickly and efficiently.
