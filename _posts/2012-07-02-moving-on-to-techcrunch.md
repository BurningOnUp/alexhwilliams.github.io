<p>Hi. I have some news. I start writing for <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> today. </p>
<p>I will write about ten posts per week, covering the enterprise beat. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beat I know well. I covered enterprise and the cloud for ReadWriteWeb. From there, I moved on to SiliconAngle where I worked for John Furrier and Dave Vellante of Wikibon Research. For SiliconAngle, I covered services (SaaS, etc.), storage and the DevOps movement. I wish John and Dave the best with their exciting ventures.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the good fortune to work with some pretty awesome people over the past few years. I&#8217;ve come to make some great friends among the community of editors, writers and analysts who I have met in my work and on the conference circuit. Thanks to all the PR folks who have become friends, too. You have a tough job but when you do it well it makes all the difference. I&#8217;d be remiss, too, if I did not mention the vendors and the users who help me make sense of some sometimes very complex and technical subject matter.</p>
<p>Thanks to my family who are the most awesome of all. Judy, Hannah and Daniel - you guys rock. And of course my mother, father, stepfather and siblings, who have always been great supporters over the years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to give a shout out to Klint Finley, a colleague who I greatly respect and look forward to working with on some data journalism and research projects.</p>
<p>Finally, ping me any time. I keep an open door&#8230;.except when I am on deadline. ;)</p>
