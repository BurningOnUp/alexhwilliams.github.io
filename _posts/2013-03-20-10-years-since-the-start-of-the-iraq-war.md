<p>In Iraq today, another 20 or so people will get executed by the increasingly authoritarian government. Some of those killed may be teenagers or young women.  </p>
<p>Depleted uranium from U.S. artillery has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/mar/06/iraq-depleted-uranium-clean-up-contamination-spreads">spread into Iraqi communities</a>. There&#8217;s a likelihood that a <span>child will be born with a nightmarish birth defect. She may have two heads or one eye. Her intestines may be on the outside of her body. </span></p>
