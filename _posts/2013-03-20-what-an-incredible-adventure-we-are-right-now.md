title: What an incredible adventure. We are right now onboard the Seabed Worker headed
  back to Cape Canaveral after finishing three weeks at sea, working almost 3 miles
  below the surface. We found so much. We’ve seen an underwater wonderland – an incredible
  sculpture garden of twisted F-1 engines that tells the story of a fiery and violent
  end, one that serves testament to the Apollo program. We photographed many beautiful
  objects in situ and have now recovered many prime pieces. Each piece we bring on
  deck conjures for me the thousands of engineers who worked together back then to
  do what for all time had been thought surely impossible.
